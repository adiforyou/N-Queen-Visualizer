# N-Queen Visualiser

- The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- This algorithm is designed using recursion and backtracking.

- Features
Visualization: Watch as the algorithm places queens on the board step-by-step.
Customizable Board Size: Adjust the size of the chessboard to visualize N-Queens solutions for different N.
Algorithm Insight: Gain insights into how recursion and backtracking solve constraint satisfaction problems like N-Queens.
